- Array vs Slices
- Test coverage
- Variadic functions
- Comparing slices
- `reflect.DeepEqual` is not "type safe"
- Slicing slices: slice[low:high]
- Assigning a function to a variable
- `testing.B` and `testing.T` are structs, whose pointer receivers implement the `testing.TB` interface. You don't want the pointer on testing.TB. The struct pointers implement that interface, and you don't need a pointer to the resulting interface value.
