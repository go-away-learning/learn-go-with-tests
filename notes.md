### The TDD process and why the steps are important

- Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
- Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
- Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with
